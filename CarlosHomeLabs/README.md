# CarlosHomeLab 🧪

Welcome to my personal 40-day home lab project where I build hands-on IT environments to simulate real-world experience in:

- ⚙️ Network Administration (Cisco Packet Tracer)
- ☁️ Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
- 🛠️ IT Support & Troubleshooting
- 🐧 Linux System Administration & Security

Each folder contains focused labs with documentation, configurations, and key learnings.

> This project is part of my career transition into IT support and network/cloud administration roles. Certified in AWS and Azure Fundamentals. Preparing for CCNA.
