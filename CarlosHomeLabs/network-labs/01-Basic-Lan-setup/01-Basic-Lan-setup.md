# Basic LAN Topology ‚Äì Cisco Packet Tracer

## üß† Objective

Simulate a basic LAN with two switches and four end devices to practice network fundamentals such as static IP configuration, connectivity testing, and cable types.

## üõ†Ô∏è Topology Overview

- **2 switches**
- **4 PCs**
- **Star topology using straight-through cables**
- **Static IP addresses**
- Devices are able to ping each other successfully.

## üß© Device Details

| Device | IP Address    | Subnet Mask     | Gateway     |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| PC0    | 192.168.1.10  | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.1.1 |
| PC1    | 192.168.1.11  | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.1.1 |
| PC2    | 192.168.1.12  | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.1.1 |
| PC3    | 192.168.1.13  | 255.255.255.0   | 192.168.1.1 |

## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed

- Connected devices using appropriate cables.
- Assigned static IPs and verified with `ipconfig`.
- Used `ping` to verify connectivity across the network.
- Documented the entire network setup and tested cable misconfigurations.

## üîç Key Learnings

- Understanding switch behavior at Layer 2.
- Differentiating between straight-through vs crossover cables.
- Practicing manual IP configuration and basic troubleshooting steps.
