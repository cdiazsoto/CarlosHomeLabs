# Dynamic Routing with OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) – Cisco Packet Tracer

##  Objective

Configure and verify **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** to dynamically exchange routing information between multiple routers.

---

##  Real-World Scenario

Your company is expanding its internal network backbone.  
To improve scalability and performance, you've been asked to migrate from RIP to OSPF across all routers:
- R1 (Headquarters)
- R2 (Branch)
- R3 (Remote Office)

OSPF will automatically share routes between routers, calculate the shortest path, and adjust when links go down.

---

##  Devices Used

- 3 Routers (R1 – HQ, R2 – Branch, R3 – Remote)
- 3 PCs (one per LAN)
- Ethernet connections between routers
- Straight-through cables for LANs

---

##  IP Addressing Table

| Device | Interface | IP Address | Subnet Mask | Description |
|---------|------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| R1 | G0/0 | 192.168.10.1 | 255.255.255.0 | HQ LAN |
| R1 | G0/1 | 10.10.10.1 | 255.255.255.0 | Link to R2 |
| R2 | G0/0 | 192.168.20.1 | 255.255.255.0 | Branch LAN |
| R2 | G0/1 | 10.10.10.2 | 255.255.255.0 | Link to R1 |
| R2 | G0/2 | 10.20.20.1 | 255.255.255.0 | Link to R3 |
| R3 | G0/0 | 192.168.30.1 | 255.255.255.0 | Remote LAN |
| R3 | G0/1 | 10.20.20.2 | 255.255.255.0 | Link to R2 |

##  Step 1 — Configure Router Interfaces

*(Ensure all interfaces are up and configured as shown in the table.)*

##  Step 2 — Enable OSPF on All Routers

### On R1:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
router ospf 1
network 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
exit
```

### ON R2:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
router ospf 1
network 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 10.20.20.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
exit
```
### ON R3:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
router ospf 1
network 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
network 10.20.20.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
exit
```

## Step 3 — Verify Neighbor Adjacency
show ip ospf neighbor


 Expected output:
Each router should see its direct neighbor listed.

---
## Step 4 — Verify Learned Routes
show ip route ospf


 You should see OSPF-learned routes marked with an O in the routing table.

## Step 5 — Test Connectivity

From PC1 (192.168.10.10):

ping 192.168.30.10 and/or 192.168.20.10


 Expected output:

Reply from 192.168.30.10: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128

## Optional — Adjust OSPF Cost to Simulate Best Path
interface g0/1
ip ospf cost 100

 Lower cost = higher priority path. OSPF dynamically recalculates the best route.

 Troubleshooting Scenarios
Problem      |Symptom	|Fix
No adjacency	|Neighbor Down	|Ensure both routers are in the same area and subnet
Routes missing	|Incomplete routing table	|Verify network statements
Link flapping	|Intermittent connectivity	|Check cable and interface status


 ## Key Takeaways

- OSPF is a link-state protocol, building a complete map of the network.
- Faster, more efficient, and scalable than RIP.
- Uses cost metric instead of hop count.

All routers in area 0 must be fully connected for adjacency.
